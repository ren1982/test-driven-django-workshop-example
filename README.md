# Test-Driven Django Development - Workshop Project

This workshop project is based on the [San Diego Python workshop on test-driven web development with Django](https://test-driven-django-development.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

While the original workshop in 2014 used Django 1.7, I used Django 3.0.3 in this project. As such, some of the code does not match what is on the documentation page of the original project. (I will eventually add documentation regarding the specific changes I made to the code.)
